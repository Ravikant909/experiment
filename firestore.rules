/**
 * @fileoverview Firestore Security Rules for SplitzyTip application.
 *
 * Core Philosophy:
 * This ruleset enforces a strict user-ownership model. Each user can only access their own profile data and the bills associated with their account.
 *
 * Data Structure:
 * - /users/{userId}: Stores user profile information. Only the authenticated user with matching {userId} can read or write their own profile.
 * - /users/{userId}/bills/{billId}: Stores bill information for a specific user. Only the authenticated user with matching {userId} can manage their own bills.
 *
 * Key Security Decisions:
 * - User listing is disallowed to prevent unauthorized access to user data.
 * - Read and write access to user profiles and bills is strictly controlled by user ownership.
 *
 * Denormalization for Authorization:
 * - Each Bill document contains a `userId` field, which is used to enforce ownership and prevent unauthorized access.
 *
 * Structural Segregation:
 * - User profiles and bills are stored in separate collections, providing a clear separation of concerns and simplifying security rules.
